/*! \mainpage AVR32 USB software framework for HID
 *
 * \section intro License
 * Use of this program is subject to Atmel's End User License Agreement.
 *
 * Please read the \ref license at the bottom of this page.
 *
 * \section install Description
 * This embedded application source code illustrates how to implement a USB HID-mouse application
 * on the AVR32 microcontroller.
 *
 * As the AVR32 implements a device/host USB controller, the embedded application can operate
 * in one of the following USB operating modes:
 *   - USB device;
 *   - USB reduced-host controller;
 *   - USB dual-role device (depending on the ID pin).
 *
 * To optimize embedded code/RAM size and reduce the number of source modules, the application can be
 * configured to use one and only one of these operating modes.
 *
 * \section sample About the Sample Application
 * By default the sample code is delivered with a simple preconfigured dual-role USB application.
 * It means that the code generated allows to operate as a device or a host depending on the USB ID pin:
 *
 *   - Attached to a mini-B plug (ID pin unconnected) the application will be used in the device operating mode.
 * Thus, the application can be connected to a system host (e.g. a PC) to operate as a USB mouse device:
 *
 * \image html appli_evk1100_device.jpg "EVK1100 USB Device Mode"
 * \image html appli_evk1101_device.jpg "EVK1101 USB Device Mode"
 *
 * The mouse can be controlled thanks to the joystick and the buttons (shown in a red box in the above pictures).
 *
 *   - Attached to a mini-A plug (ID pin tied to ground) the application will operate in reduced-host mode.
 * This mode allows to connect a USB mouse device:
 *
 * \image html appli_evk1100_host.jpg "EVK1100 USB Host Mode"
 * \image html appli_evk1101_host.jpg "EVK1101 USB Host Mode"
 *
 * In this mode, a mouse ascii pointer is output on the USART1 connector. Open a serial terminal (e.g. HyperTerminal under
 * Windows systems or minicom under Linux systems; USART settings: 57600 bauds, 8-bit data, no parity bit,
 * 1 stop bit, no flow control). Make sure that the  serial terminal takes in charge the ANSI codes.

 *
 * \section device_use Using the USB Device Mode
 * Connect the application to a USB host (e.g. a PC) with a mini-B (embedded side) to A (PC host side) cable.
 * The application will behave as a mouse peripheral. The mouse can be controlled thanks to the joystick and
 * the buttons of the EVK110x.
 *
 * \section host_use Using the USB Host Mode
 * Connect the application to a USB mouse device. The application will behave as a USB mouse
 * reduced host. Leds will blink according to the mouse eactivity and a mouse ascii pointer is output on the USART1 connector.
 *
 * @section arch Architecture
 * As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the hid_example.c file.
 * The application can be ran using the FreeRTOS operating system, or in standalone mode.
 * In the standalone mode, the main function runs the usb_task and device_mouse_hid_task tasks in an infinite loop.
 *
 * The application is based on three different tasks:
 * - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level
 * enumeration process in device mode.
 * Once this task has detected that the usb connection is fully operationnal, it updates different status flags
 * that can be check within the high level application tasks.
 * - The device_mouse_hid_task task performs the high level device application operation.
 * Once the device is fully enumerated (DEVICE SET_CONFIGURATION request received), the task
 * transmit data (reports) on its IN endpoint.
 * - The host_mouse_hid_task task performs the high level host application operation.
 * Once a device is connected and fully enumerated, the task
 * receive data (reports) on its IN endpoint.
 *
